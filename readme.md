# JS Basic

## let variables vs const constants
- using `let` as variables can change.
- using `const` as variables, it can't be changed.
*Pro Tip: use `const` as often as possible as it makes it clear on your intentions. It shows that the data never changes. Also it shows good coding practice.*

**Good Variable Names**
- camelCase: `let userName`
- letters and digits: `let ageGroup5`
- starting with $: `let $kindOfSpecial`
- starting with _: `let _internalValue`

**Not Good Variable Names**
- snake case: `let user_name`
- starting with digit: `let21Players`
- no other special characters: `let user-b`
- reserved keywords: `let let`

## Strings and Commenting
**Commenting**
- one line comment using `// <content>`
- multiple line comment using `/* <content> */` 

**More on Strings in JS**
- regarding single quotes or double quotes. Feel free to use it accordingly. But be consistent
- use backticks to add dynamic values like `${}`
- backticks also allow multiple lines
- using `white-space: pre;` backticks with white spaces will add line break spacing.
- using `\n` for normal double quotes will add line break spacing
- to have backslash or single quotes string, put backslash in front of it `\\` `\'`

## Functions
- functions are code on demand
- it is predefined first. It doesn't get executed. then you call the function with parameters if there's any
- parenthesis with arguments will execute the code when the page is loaded. e.g. `add(1,2)` is a parenthesis with argument. `add` is just a function. Assuming the function is defined earlier.

## Converting Data Types
- use `parseInt(<value>)` to convert a string to int. you can also put `+<value>` in front of the string.
- embed syntax like `${<value>}` auto converts everything within it into string.

## Additional Data Types
- numbers, string, booleans, objects, arrays
- booleans `true` or `false`
- objects: `{ name: "Max", age: 31 }`
- arrays: `[1, "3", True]`

**Special Values**
- `undefined`: default value of uninitialized variables. You shouldn't assign undefined as a value
- `null`: never assumed by default. You have to set this with equals.
- `NaN`: stands for Not a Number. Technically a number type. `3 * "hi"` yields `NaN`

**typeof operator**
- typeof is used to check the type of a variable at runtime.
- `userName = "Max"`, then use `typeof userName` will return `string`

## Importing scripts properly
- `defer` and `async` is only works for external scripts. Internal scripts inside the documents doesn't benefit from them.
- `defer` load early, execute later. Scripts with defer never block the page. Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).
- `async` load early, execute as soon as possible. The page content shows up immediately: async doesnâ€™t block it. DOMContentLoaded may happen both before and after async, no guarantees here.

## Operators
- `++<value>` return value after the change
- `<value>--` return value before the change
- other operators: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `**` exponentiation, `%` divide two numbers yielding remainder.

**Boolean Operators and Conditions**
- `===` is better than `==`. `!==` is better than `!=`. This is because it not only checks for value, but also checks for type.
- when comparing strings, `b` is greater than `a` because JS compares Unicode values.
- `condition` in `if (condition) {}` should be just a boolean. Example below. Redundant to add an equation inside the condition. [Click here for more details](documentation/03_booleans-text-comparisons)
```
const isLoggedIn = true;
if (isLoggedIn) {
    // This code will execute because isLoggedIn is true => A valid condition
}
```

**Comparing Objects**
- Two same objects stored in different variables, when compared with `===` and `==` are not the same. e.g.
```
const person1 = {name: "Max"}
const person2 = {name: "Max"}

person1 === person2 // yields false

const person3 = person1
person3 === person1 // yields true
```

**Operator Precedence**
- [Click here for a list of operator procedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

**Falsy and Truthy Values**
- It is mainly used to ensure that a value is not `""`, `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`. [Click here for flasy and truthy values](/public/flasy-truthy-values.png)
- Sometimes we have functions that doesn't work with falsy values. [Click here for flasy and truthy explained](/public/falsy-truthy-explained.png)
- JS tries to coerce a variable into boolean with no explicit instructions are given. It doesn't convert the variable into true or false statements though. [Click here for coercion vs conversion](/documentation/04_coercion-vs-conversion.md)
```
let userInput = 'Max';
if (userInput) {
    ... // this code here will execute because 'Max' is "truthy" (all strings but empty strings are)
}
```

## Ternary Operator vs Conditional Expressions
- this is a ternary operator `const userName = isLogin ? "MAX" : null` without which you will write longer code like below
```
const userName = if (isLogin) {
    return "Max";
} else {
    return null;
}
```
