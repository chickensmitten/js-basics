# JS Basic

## let variables vs const constants
- using `let` as variables can change.
- using `const` as variables, it can't be changed.
*Pro Tip: use `const` as often as possible as it makes it clear on your intentions. It shows that the data never changes. Also it shows good coding practice.*

**Good Variable Names**
- camelCase: `let userName`
- letters and digits: `let ageGroup5`
- starting with $: `let $kindOfSpecial`
- starting with _: `let _internalValue`

**Not Good Variable Names**
- snake case: `let user_name`
- starting with digit: `let21Players`
- no other special characters: `let user-b`
- reserved keywords: `let let`
